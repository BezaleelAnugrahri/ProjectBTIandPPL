US M1 Carbine

Thank you for downloading my second model.

I was happy because I thought I made a historically accurate model. Then I showed it to some old timers and they pointed out so many things that were not correct. Then I was sad.

Oh well, I had fun making it. I'll get around to doing the correct models when I have time.

Future projects - Historically accurate versions of
M1 Carbine 1942 (original)
M1A1 Carbine (folding)
M1 Carbine 1944 (adjustable sights)
M2 Carbine (full automatic)
Texturing and scaling of my M1911A1 available on this site (so it matches the carbine)

This is my first try at hand painted textures so I textured each little piece separately to be more accurate. I suppose you can combine all the pieces into 1 mesh when the textures are in place.

The texture maps are in the M1CarbineBlue folder.
The diagrams about which mesh connects to which texture are in the diagrams folder.

As usual, copyright - shmopyrite! Feel free to use it. As I said, I had fun doing this, so enjoy. If you use it for anything, just let me know so I can enoy your work too. Or better yet, send me some renders. I realize there are lots of extremely talented 3d artists out there who are much, much better than I am. I would love to see your work.

If you have any problems with this or just want to give me a comment about it, contact me at chucknepo@yahoo.com

Thanks,
Chuck
